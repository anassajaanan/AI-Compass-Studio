3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.860
it really is the perfect candidate for a
4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.960
place for crypto to boom I think they're
5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.760
going to be in the Forefront of this
6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.800
revolution in my opinion is like the
7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.420
Catalyst openers achieve this dream of
8
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.779
making Nigeria a better place
9
00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.320
and then on 5th of February CBN or at
10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.539
least a secular you know to banks that
11
00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.399
they should stop supporting crypto
12
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.760
companies in 2020 we have these big
13
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.100
protest across the country called and
14
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.520
such
15
00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.399
there have been a bunch of concerns
16
00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.739
about police brutality and the actions
17
00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.480
of the police in the Nigerian States
18
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.020
it's a fundamental policy issue it's a
19
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.239
fundamental leadership issue in our
20
00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.520
country they lock you up and the only
21
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.520
thing that they expect you to do is to
22
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.100
pay them off what's money when you don't
23
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.260
have life what's money when the police
24
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.140
can harass you so you even using crypto
25
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.520
you're in danger already
