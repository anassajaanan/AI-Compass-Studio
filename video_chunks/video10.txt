Looking for Mercedes AMG GT Black Series, difficult to find one when there are only just a handful of these babies in the world. What if I tell you you can own a part of the car, drive it, and sell it for a profit by buying a limited one of 12 NFTs? Sounds pretty cool!

M-Content is introducing the world's first car ownership NFT, the Project Black, which gives you the opportunity to own part of the world's most popular AMG right here. This one and you get another art masterpiece designed by a world-famous NFT artist drawn live at the world's first AMG store in Dubai. So you get two NFTs for the price of one, and it gets better than this - the car is yours to drive for a whole 30 days each year.
